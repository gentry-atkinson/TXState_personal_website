<h4>Logo Command Survey</h4>
<p>
I am developing a natural language interpretor for the Logo educational computer language. You can help my effort by taking this survey.
</p>

<p>
The Logo language was devloped in 1967 as a way to help people learn how to interact with computers using written commands. With Logo, a user can draw simple images by guiding a Turtle around a Canvas using a small list of simple commands. There are many interpretors available for people who are willing to learn the commands. My intention is to expand the original vision of the Logo project by giving it the ability to understand commands written in plain English.

<p>
In this survey you will be shown a pair of images with a short text description of the change that has occured between the two images. Please type the directions in plain English that you would give in order to cause this change to happen.

I would like to thank <a href="https://www.kde.org/applications/education/kturtle">K-Turtle</a> from KDE for providing the excellent Logo interpretor that I've used to produce this images.
