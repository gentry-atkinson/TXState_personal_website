<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>
I'm recently separated from the US Army and am very happy to be working and learning with the Texas State CS department. I was born in Houston, TX and first moved to Austin in 2011. I have lived in many other places but Austin is the best of all of them (San Marcos is lovely too). I first developed an interest in Computer Science through my interest in robotics. I started trying to make them since I was 13 and eventually came to the realization that I'm handier with a compiler than with a soldering iron.
