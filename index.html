<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>
I'm recently separated from the US Army and am very happy to be working and learning with the Texas State CS department. I was born in Houston, TX and first moved to Austin in 2011. I have lived in many other places but Austin is the best of all of them (San Marcos is lovely too). I first developed an interest in Computer Science through my interest in robotics. I started trying to make them since I was 13 and eventually came to the realization that I'm handier with a compiler than with a soldering iron.
</p>
<p>
My first research work at Texas State University was with prefessors Grayson Lawrence and Dr. Dan Tamir on an iOS app we called Musing. It brought augmented reality into the school's art gallery and provide patrons with additional information about the artworks they were viewing. Musing was able to recognize artworks and automatically provide the user with the information available for a particualr work using methods provided by the computer vision library OpenCV.
